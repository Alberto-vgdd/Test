    //      Release lock-on if the enemy stays 2 secs behind a wall.

    // PLAYER MOVEMENT SCRIPT
    //      Make the player properly turn around when the stick is rapidly moved. 
    //      Make the player turn around smoothly

    // CAMERA & LOCK-ON && PLAYER MOVEMENT SCRIPT
    //      Make every script compatible (Clean the code).
    //      Implement a better input system.

    // OUTSIDE UNITY
    //      Look for a Photoshop alternative.
