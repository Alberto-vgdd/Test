    // CAMERA & LOCK-ON
	//      Change the implementation of LockableEnemies from LinkedList<Transform> to a better alternative.
    //      Move lock-On features to a proper place.
    //      Un-lock enemies when player leaves the area.
    //      Pressing the Right Thumb whith no enemies near should center the camera to match player's forward vector.
    //      Weird bug that causes the camera turn around the player when the lock-on is enabled when the player is not facing the enemy.

    // PLAYER MOVEMENT SCRIPT
    //      Make the player properly turn around when the stick is rapidly moved.

    // OUTSIDE UNITY
    //      Look for a Photoshop alternative.
