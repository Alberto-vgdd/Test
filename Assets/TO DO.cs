    // CAMERA & LOCK-ON
    //      Pressing the Right Thumb whith no enemies near should center the camera to match player's forward vector.
    //      Change locked enemy  with left and right on the RT.
    //      Raycast from player to avoid lock on through walls

    // PLAYER MOVEMENT SCRIPT
    //      Make the player properly turn around when the stick is rapidly moved. 
    //      The camera shakes when the player walks into a wall.

    // OUTSIDE UNITY
    //      Look for a Photoshop alternative.
